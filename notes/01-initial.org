The subscription and transaction implementation is mostly done. The pattern is solid:
+ API request / response lifecycle is controlled by controller only.
+ Business logic is only being handled by service.
    + No implementation detail of specific infrastructure code is introduced in the layer.
    + Database transaction is being handled by Transaction Manager that will be called in the service layer.
+ Repository interface is solid, it is exposes several function, and being abstracted in the ~common~ code.
    + Here's the function that can be called:
        + ~Each~: loop through the entity on the repository, using cursor if it's supported.
        + ~List~: retrieve list of the entity.
        + ~Get~: retrieve a entity from the repository.
        + ~Save~: upsert entity.
        + ~Delete~: delete entity.
    + ~Each~, ~List~, ~Get~, and ~Delete~ all of them accept Specification, which specifies which data will be retrieved or deleted.
